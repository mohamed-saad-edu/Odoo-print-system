/**
 * Product brand: supplied "Print Gateway" lockups (WP6-BRANDING).
 *
 * The artwork ships as files under `public/brand/` (Gateway) and as the
 * sanitized SVG/PNG/ICO icon set (Gateway favicon, Desktop icon, Tauri
 * bundle, Odoo Apps-list icon). The lockup text is baked into the artwork
 * as paths — there is no live text to translate — so the locale switch is
 * done with `dir`, not with JavaScript: the EN lockup shows under
 * `dir="ltr"` and the AR lockup under `dir="rtl"`. Both images stay in the
 * DOM and CSS hides the inactive one, which keeps this component usable
 * from server components (landing, pricing) that cannot read the client
 * locale store, and matches the pre-paint `lang`/`dir` script in
 * `src/app/layout.tsx` (no EN text ever renders on an Arabic page, and
 * vice versa). Aspect ratio is never overridden: lockups size by height
 * with `w-auto`.
 *
 * DARK SURFACES (v11-darklogo): the lockup wordmark is black-filled
 * artwork in the light files, so it would vanish on a dark header — and
 * the old fix (a white chip behind it in BOTH modes) is exactly what
 * looked wrong in dark mode: a glaring white block on a near-black
 * surface. There are now dedicated dark variants
 * (`public/brand/print-gateway-{en,ar}-dark.svg`) with the SAME layout,
 * proportions and icon, but white text (main line and subline both
 * #ffffff). BrandMark renders all four images and CSS in globals.css
 * shows exactly one pair, chosen by `[dir]` x `[data-theme]` — the
 * app's real theme mechanism (pre-paint script + ThemeToggle flip the
 * `data-theme` attribute on <html>, so the swap follows a live theme
 * toggle and stays server-component safe. The wrapper is now
 * clearspace only: `p-3` padding, NO background, NO ring, in either
 * mode, so no visible block ever appears behind the lockup. The
 * icon-only mark is a cyan tile with a light glyph and needs no chip.
 * CLEARSPACE (v10-exact, kept): the p-3 (12px) padding meets the
 * guide's >=1/4-mark rule even under the most conservative reading
 * (mark height = full lockup height: 48px -> 12px needed, 40px -> 10px,
 * 38px -> 9.5px).
 *
 * CALL-SITE COMPATIBILITY: `title`, `subtitle` and `variant` are kept in
 * the props so existing call sites need no edits, but they are NOT
 * rendered anymore — the lockup artwork supersedes the old "Yaseir /
 * Print Manager" wordmark (including the platform "Control Plane"
 * subline; the control-plane badge and aria labels elsewhere still carry
 * that distinction). Pass `showWordmark={false}` for the icon-only mark
 * (collapsed rails). `BrandMarkIcon` is the same icon as inline SVG so
 * it also works in the Desktop Vite/Tauri build, where an absolute
 * `/brand/...` URL would not resolve under the relative `base: "./"`.
