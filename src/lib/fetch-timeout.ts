 * composition remains active for the complete response stream, including
 * cloned responses, without wrapping or buffering any Response body.
 *
 * Note: after headers, the browser may surface AbortError rather than our
 * pre-header timeout message. The body is still aborted and is NOT safe to
 * treat as an unsubmitted mutation or immediately retry a print operation.

/**
 * Retry-once-after-refresh wrapper for workspace fetches. `fetchWithTimeout`
 * above is deliberately unchanged: existing callers keep its exact behaviour.
 *
 * Rules (session policy is NOT changed by this wrapper):
 * - Only a 401 triggers recovery. 403 (including CSRF/origin),
 *   subscription/authorization errors, 5xx, and network failures are never
 *   treated as refreshable and are returned untouched.
 * - On a refreshable 401, `ensureCustomerSession()` runs exactly once
 *   (single-flight via its own in-memory flight + Web Locks — never
 *   reimplemented here). If it reports authenticated:false, or if it
 *   throws (network/5xx), the ORIGINAL 401 response is returned: no
 *   second refresh, no retry loop, and no navigation decision here —
 *   callers own redirects.
 * - `autoRetry: true` (default): the SAME request is replayed exactly once
 *   with the same input/init, so an Idempotency-Key header or an identical
 *   payload is reused verbatim. Callers must only use this for reads or
 *   for mutations that are idempotent by design (see each call site).
 * - `autoRetry: false`: the request is NOT resent. Instead a synthetic
 *   401 response marked with `SESSION_RENEWED_NOT_RESENT_HEADER` is
 *   returned. Callers check `isSessionRenewedNotResent()` FIRST and show
 *   a "session renewed — please retry" notice without a login redirect
 *   and without clearing form state; the user resubmits explicitly.
 * - This wrapper never redirects, never touches cookies or browser
 *   storage: a silent refresh only renews the access token, it does not
 *   extend idle time.
